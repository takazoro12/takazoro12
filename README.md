- 👋 Hi, I’m @takazoro12
- 👀 I’m interested in play the game.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP, Ruby(on rails), React, Javescript, jQuery, and .... APEX Legends!!(seriously) 

　　　I am like a baby who has just started learning programming.But my motivation, perseverance, and ambition are higher than anyone else's.
   Because it's about finding your future. When learning programming,I will soon hit a big wall!　I don't even know how to use this github right now(you'll figure it out when you see it).　It's makes me feek hot to see a tweet from someone at Microsoft(I'm not in love). I can't wait to get to that stage.
   If you see any growth, give me a shout.　I'll just keep trying！！

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
